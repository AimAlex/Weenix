# Weenix OS
*This repository is a placeholder for Weenix Operating System which I implemented as part of the graduate level course, CSCI 402 (Spring 2022), taught at USC by Prof. Bill Cheng.*

Notes:
- The actual repository, which contains the source code, has been made private so as to honour the code of conduct of the University. It will only be available to potential employers who want to assess my capabilities in similar domains (and also who will agree not to share it with anyone else too). If you want to look at the code, please contact me directly.
- For more info about the course and instructor, see: http://merlot.usc.edu/william/usc/
- My program passed all tests and got full marks including bonus.
